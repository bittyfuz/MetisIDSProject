The data set I am studying includes features which are conditions of sunspots before a solar flare erupts, with the target being the class of the solar flare.

With this data, I'd like to find out what features are most/least important for predicting the class of solar flare, and to find out how reliably I can predict the class.

So far, what I know about this data is that magnetic fields on the Sun cause sunspots and solar flares, so I expect that conditions of sunspots are correlated with the strength solar flare activity and can hopefully predict it fairly accurately.

I chose this topic because I do astrophysics (cosmology), and I did a small project on how solar activity affects space weather as an undergrad, so this data set looked interesting to me.
